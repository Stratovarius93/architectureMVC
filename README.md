# architectureMVC

This project is a demonstration of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern implemented in Swift using the UIKit framework. The goal of this project is to showcase a structured and modular approach to developing iOS applications, promoting separation of concerns and code organization.

## Architecture Overview

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a widely adopted architectural pattern in iOS app development. It helps in organizing the codebase and separating concerns to improve maintainability and testability. Here's a brief overview of the MVC components:

- **Model**: The model represents the data and business logic of the application. It encapsulates data structures, algorithms, and validation rules.

- **View**: The view is responsible for presenting the user interface to the user. It displays the model's data and responds to user actions, forwarding them to the controller for processing.

- **Controller**: The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It receives user input from the view, updates the model accordingly, and updates the view to reflect the changes in the model.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure, separating different components into their respective directories. Here's a brief overview of the project structure:
```shell
├── Model/
│ └── // Contains model classes and business logic.
├── View/
│ └── // Contains view-related classes and UI components.
├── Controller/
│ └── // Contains controller classes, responsible for managing the flow of data and user interactions.
└── Resources/
└── // Contains any additional resources (e.g., images, fonts) used in the project.
```
